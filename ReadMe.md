# ðŸ”” Smart Cane for Visually Impaired Individuals

A Raspberry Pi-powered assistive device designed to **enhance mobility and safety** for visually impaired individuals. The smart cane detects nearby obstacles and alerts the user through a buzzer. It also includes a tilt detection mechanism to notify in case of a potential fall.

## ðŸš€ Overview

This project was built during a hackathon with the aim of developing a **lightweight, cost-effective, and reliable smart mobility aid**. The device mounts on a traditional walking cane and leverages sensors to:

- **Detect obstacles** using:
  - An **IR sensor** for short-range detection
  - An **ultrasonic sensor** for mid-range distance sensing
- **Detect falls or sudden tilts** using a **tilt switch**
- **Alert the user** using a **buzzer** if any sensor is triggered

---

## ðŸ§  How It Works

The Raspberry Pi continuously monitors:
- The IR sensor (obstacles at very close range)
- The ultrasonic sensor (objects < 15 cm)
- The tilt switch (indicative of a fall or cane being dropped)

When **any of these conditions** are detected:
- A **buzzer activates** to alert the user.
