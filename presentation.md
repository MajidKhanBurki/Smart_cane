## 🔊 **1. Introduction (\~30 seconds)**

> *(One team member)*
> “Hello everyone, we’re Bhaskar, Majid, and Devansh — and this is our project: a **Smart Cane for the Visually Impaired**.
> It’s a low-cost, Raspberry Pi-powered assistive device designed to **help blind or visually impaired individuals walk safely** by detecting obstacles and falls — and giving real-time audio alerts.”

---

## 🧠 **2. Motivation (\~30 seconds)**

> *(Another team member)*
> “Many visually impaired individuals rely on traditional canes — but these don’t detect overhead obstacles or provide fall detection.
> Our goal was to build a smart, affordable device using common sensors that could **enhance mobility, independence, and safety** — especially in unfamiliar or crowded environments.”

## 🛠 **3. Technical Overview (\~1 min)**

> *(Can be split between 2 members)*

* “We’re using a **Raspberry Pi** as the brain of the device.”
* “The **IR sensor** detects close-range obstacles directly in front of the cane.”
* “The **ultrasonic sensor** detects objects within 15 cm — great for mid-range hazards like walls or trash bins.”
* “A **tilt switch** detects if the cane — or the user — has fallen.”
* “We added a **touch switch**, which can act as a manual trigger or safety alert.”
* “A **buzzer** provides audible feedback whenever any hazard or fall is detected.”

## 💡 **4. Live Demo (\~1 min 30 seconds)**

> *(While holding the cane or pointing to sensors)*

🎯 Show each sensor triggering the buzzer one by one:

1. **IR Sensor**

   > “Now when I bring my hand close to the IR sensor — you’ll hear the buzzer go off.”

2. **Ultrasonic Sensor**

   > “Now I’ll bring an object within 15 cm. The ultrasonic sensor picks it up — and again, the buzzer activates.”

3. **Tilt Switch**

   > *(Tilt or shake the cane slightly)*
   > “If the user falls or drops the cane — the tilt sensor detects it — and triggers an alert.”

4. **Touch Switch**

   > *(Tap or touch the switch)*
   > “The touch sensor can act as a panic button or manual signal to caregivers.”

✅ Show that buzzer doesn’t activate when nothing is detected

> “When no obstacle or fall is detected, the buzzer stays silent.”

## 🔄 **5. Future Improvements (\~30 seconds)**

> *(Optional, if time permits)*
> “In the future, we’d love to add:

* A **vibration motor** for silent alerts
* **GPS tracking** for fall location detection
* **Voice feedback**
* A companion **mobile app** for real-time caregiver alerts.”
